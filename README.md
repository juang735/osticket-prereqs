In my first lab, I created a Microsoft Azure account, which allows me to do a variety of powerful things in the cloud:
Store important files: I can upload pictures, videos, and documents to a secure place in the cloud, keeping them safe and accessible from anywhere.
Build websites or apps: Azure lets me create and host my own websites or applications, so they can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection.
Run virtual computers: I can set up virtual machines in the cloud and access them from my own device—like a laptop or phone—without needing a high-powered computer.

Using Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) on Microsoft Azure allows you to connect to a virtual computer—one that's running in the cloud—from your own device, such as a laptop or tablet. It feels just like you're sitting in front of that remote machine, even though it’s located far away.
To get started, you'll need to choose an operating system (OS), typically Windows Server or Windows 10, since these are compatible with Remote Desktop connections.

Using Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) on Microsoft Azure lets you access a virtual computer running in the cloud from your own device—like a laptop or tablet. Even though the virtual machine is hosted remotely, it feels as if you're using it right in front of you.

To begin, you’ll need to select an operating system, usually Windows Server or Windows 10, since both support Remote Desktop access.
