In my first lab, I created a Microsoft Azure account, which allows me to do a variety of powerful things in the cloud:
Store important files: I can upload pictures, videos, and documents to a secure place in the cloud, keeping them safe and accessible from anywhere.
Build websites or apps: Azure lets me create and host my own websites or applications, so they can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection.
Run virtual computers: I can set up virtual machines in the cloud and access them from my own device—like a laptop or phone—without needing a high-powered computer.

Using Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) on Microsoft Azure allows you to connect to a virtual computer—one that's running in the cloud—from your own device, such as a laptop or tablet. It feels just like you're sitting in front of that remote machine, even though it’s located far away.
To get started, you'll need to choose an operating system (OS), typically Windows Server or Windows 10, since these are compatible with Remote Desktop connections.

The Command Prompt is a tool in Windows that lets you type text commands to control your computer. You can use it to navigate folders, create or delete files, run programs, and check system information. It’s especially useful for troubleshooting or performing tasks more quickly than using the regular interface. Advanced users can also write scripts to automate repetitive tasks.

 If you accidentally delete a document or email, the first thing to do is check the Recycle Bin or Deleted Items folder—many files or emails can be easily restored from there. If it’s not there, some cloud services like Microsoft OneDrive or Outlook have a second-stage recycle bin or Recover Deleted Items option. You can also try checking your backups if you have them set up. If none of these work, you might contact your IT department or service provider for further recovery options. Acting quickly gives you the best chance of getting the file or email back.

 In most organizations, manager, employees or help desk are responsible for creating tickets when they experience an issue or need support. This is usually done through a help desk system or IT service portal. Once the ticket is submitted, the IT or support team takes over to review, assign, and resolve the issue. Creating a ticket helps track problems and ensures they are handled in an organized way.

 When a customer calls saying their computer or internet is slow, first ask questions to understand the issue—like when it started, if it happens with all websites or programs, and if others are affected. Then, guide them through basic troubleshooting steps, such as restarting the computer or router. You can also check for background programs, system updates, or network issues. If the problem isn’t resolved, you may need to escalate the issue or create a support ticket for further investigation.
