In my first lab i created a microsoft azure account where i can create Store stuff: You can upload pictures, videos, or important documents to a special place in the cloud where they’re safe.

Building websites or apps: You can make your own websites or apps and host them on Azure, so people can visit them from anywhere.

Running virtual computers: You can use Azure to create virtual computers in the cloud that you can access from your own device (like a laptop or phone) without needing a powerful computer.

Using Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) on Microsoft Azure is a way to connect to a virtual computer (a computer that's running on Azure) from your own device, like a laptop or a tablet. It's like you’re using a computer that’s far away, but it feels like you’re right there using it! Here's how you can do it: Pick an OS (Windows or Linux). For a Remote Desktop connection, you'll probably choose a Windows Server or Windows 10 machine.

The Command Prompt (also called CMD) is a tool that lets you type in commands to control your computer. It's like talking to your computer in a special language where you tell it what to do, and it follows your instructions. I can create new files or folders directly from Command Prompt, and get information about your computer, like what’s installed or how much space is left.
